# LoFi

## Overview

Light, Camera, Action! LoFi Transforms You Into NFT Avatars.

LoFi is evolving towards a metaverse communication hub where NFT holders can express their values and actively interact with others free and openly.

LoFi enables perfect real-time matching of the user’s face with the NFT. 

Users can appear in their favorite NFTs, broadcast, and communicate on streaming or social platforms like Twitter, Youtube, Twitch, Skype, Zoom, etc. Our AI-driven technology empowers breathing life and ingenuity into their NFTs free and openly via diverse activities in the ecosystem. 

We allow NFT users to gather and engage in social activities. Also, conversations with friends on Twitter can be shared in a thread format.

When first entering the world of LoFi, any NFT holders can claim $LoFi tokens based on the value of their NFTs by simply connecting the wallets. 

Subsequently, users can earn rewards in the most efficient and fun ways through broadcasting, streaming, sponsoring, and communicating with others while enjoying LoFi’s universe. 

The value of the token is beyond imagination. 

Not only will $LoFi holders get their LoFi token back from Community Treasury, but they also earn tokens just by watching the show. Also, if you work hard on the broadcast, you can get a sponsorship (donation) with a $LoFi token. Due to its broadcast-based nature, its liquidity is high, which is a very positive sign for the value of the LoFi token. LoFi will continue to expand, and the $LoFi token used in these ecosystems will continue to evolve.
